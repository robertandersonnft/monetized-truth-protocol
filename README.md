# monetized-truth-protocol
The Monetized Truth Protocol (MTP) codifies how identity-bound, verifiable actions are scored, tokenized, and rewarded in decentralized ecosystems. This repo contains the core logic, examples, documentation, and integration modules for using MTP across Web3 environments.

# üß† Monetized Truth Protocol (MTP)

The **Monetized Truth Protocol** enables decentralized systems to quantify, score, and reward verifiable action, authenticated identity, and provable intent.

> Truth is not just protected ‚Äî it's monetized.

## üìê MTS Formula


Where:
- A = Action Proof (e.g. match verified on-chain)
- I = Identity Entropy (IDoS strength)
- V = Validator Certainty
- R = Reputation Score
- F = Feedback Accuracy (agentic consensus)
- S = Staked Intent
